/*
 Per the design we need to use Gray 10/Black for our banner background color, which can be set with the $ui-01 color token. 
 Also, we want the background to extend into the gridâ€™s outermost gutters to go the full width of the viewport, so given the DOM structure, 
 we can achieve that by setting the background in an absolutely positioned pseudo element.
